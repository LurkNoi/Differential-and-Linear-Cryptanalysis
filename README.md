# Differential-and-Linear-Cryptanalysis

## Issues

- [ ] Still need to manually simplify POS (with Logic Friday) when using MILP to model S-Box

- [ ] Equations is too long for large (8-bit) S-Box (Logic Friday buffer size only 64k char.)

## TODO

- [ ] simplify logical condition with python

- [ ] modeling Feistel Network
